# Take One Picture Project Website 

This is a website I crearted for my mum. Every year, the National Gallery runs a 'Take One Picture' project, where they suggest a painting from its collection for schools to use as a stimulus for art and cross-curricular learning üé® üñº. My mum is a primary school teacher and is often involved in shaping and running these art projects for her school and others in the district.

The website I've created aims to give an overview of her upcoming project and some of the previous ones she has put together. It will be used as a resource that she can give out to other teachers to inspire them for their own projects, or to learn more! She wanted a simple, sleek, accessible, and easy-to-use site, and I'm happy with how it's come out üòÅ.

Deployed site: https://take-one-picture-project.vercel.app/

## Technologies used

I wanted to use this opportunity to carry on learning and developing my skills, therefore I used a technologies and packages that I was not too familiar with: 
- NextJS 
- TypeScript 
- Cypress (automated testing with GitHub actions)
- EmailJS
- Embla

## Process 

My mum was somewhat of a client when I was building this site (a non-paying client may I add!), so I wanted to shape the process as if it were a real-world project in industry. The process: 
- Ideating together on Miro 
- Creating user personas 
- Creating low and high-fidelity wireframes 
- Consistent feedback while I was building the site (I deployed the site from scratch so she could have a live feed as I was adding to it)

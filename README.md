# Take One Picture Project Website 

This is a website I crearted for my mum. Every year, the National Gallery runs a 'Take One Picture' project, where they suggest a painting from its collection for schools to use as a stimulus for art and cross-curricular learning 🎨 🖼. My mum is a primary school teacher and is often involved in shaping and running these art projects for her school and others in the district.

The website I've created aims to give an overview of her upcoming project and some of the previous ones she has put together. It will be used as a resource that she can give out to other teachers to inspire them for their own projects, or to learn more! She wanted a sleek, accessible, and easy-to-use site, and I'm happy with how it's come out 😁.
